# python-decorators
Some useful decorators for Python3 code.

This repo is for in-home use, just to keep around several useful tools that I'm familiar with.

Heavily taken from https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary . Take a look there if you want to use it, code there is probably written by more proficient folks, there's more of it and it may have been updated later than this repo.

Not sure about the license though.
